# HTC-sous-dev
app for helping developers at HTC with automating GUI tasks

---
### Building from source
Run:
```sh
$ make.sh 
```
You will need to also have [htcLib](https://github.com/NYHTC/applescript-fm-helper) app.

Once both are compiled, make sure to allow assistive devices for both apps. You will need to re-enable assistive devices each time either app is compiled.
